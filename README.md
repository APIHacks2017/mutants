===================

### Slogan: **One app to rule them all**.

There is a rapid growth in mobile computing which allows mobile applications to access and manipulate information from anywhere at any time. Thanks to the advent of smart devices and the emergence of 3G/4G wireless technologies, services over mobile phones are becoming in many respects similar to those available over the PC based internet.
The growth of the smartphone user base has been increased and increasing every day and now 80% of internet users own smartphones. When companies like Google invests it’s money to make an affordable smartphone for poor people, there is still some problem for the end user where they can’t install most useful apps because of the space issue.  So, why not just make an app to provide the most useful services they consume every day.

At any point of the day, an average user consumes any of the following apps in their daily life: news app, petrol price, Bus and railway route/timings, Cricket updates and restaurant search. So, we aim to provide a single app which provides the most useful public services, entertainment, food search to people which are most needed apps for every user and let’s keep touching ever!
